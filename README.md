### Midi Mode

Midi Mode turns off the default sounds and sends all notes to the selected midi output.

### Channels

By default Astral uses channels 1-8 based on the triggering body's mass. Although you may wish to send all output to a single midi channel, if for example you want all bodies no matter their size to trigger a single instrument. All bodies can be set to fire on channel 1,2 or 3.
